# Animated UPBGE Logo Instructions

- I used UPBGE **0.25b** to make the image

- You'll need to restate file paths in several places, as they are currently set to my setup

- I downloaded the UPBGE logo mesh source from: https://blenderartists.org/t/upbge-logo-designer-help/677865/34 [**logo_2.blend**]

- I GIF conversion/exported using the Blender addon **Bligify**: https://github.com/doakey3/Bligify [there are versions for both **2.79** + **+2.8**]
